#### Description:
			
Hello I'm Arshia Jannat Makan From Iran  Rasht city
I'm 15 years old.
I have been working in the field of robotics and programming for three years.
I have worked with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python languages (intermediate level upwards)
And HTML and CSS markup languages.
And I also work in robotics and I have participated in competitions.
I have also just started teaching programming I have 9 students.

My project is a game using the C++ language => name: Monster


To build this project, I researched vector to use it

This game, although it runs in the console environment, 
but it has its charms. I also used colors in this project.


In this project I used two classes => Monster and Player
And for each task I have used separate functions so that each function has its own unique task
I used the "switch case" to build the menu
And the playerInit function specifies the initial location of the player


**Description of the code**
First I defined the libraries needed for the project
I defined the mark required in the game as const
A struct is defined for the position so that the location of all components has one variable.
In the player class, the player's position is first determined by the random function
Several functions have been written to move 
monsters that move randomly and in a controlled manner with a bit of monster intelligence.
And I wrote two functions to show the winner or loser
And I created a function for the menu and used the switch case in it
And I used the switch case and W-A-S-D to move the player
I called the menu_page function in the main function to run the whole program
is available => This function checks whether the player is alive or not
I used colors to make the code more beautiful in the console environment, which uses system functions
All movements in the earth or the construction of the earth are made using two-dimensional array
The wallInit function is used to specify the location of the walls first, which is random
When playing, the number of coins in the game and the coins taken are displayed at the top of the screen
cls is used to clear the page



At the beginning you enter your name 
And then a menu opens to get started

    *Option one to start the game*
    *Option two to guide the game*
    *Option three about me*

When you select the start option
It takes the height and width of the ground from you and asks you for the number of coins in the ground

You play with the W-A-S-D keys and scroll left and right
You can't cross the walls
If you deal with monsters, you lose
And if you get all the coins, you win

coin => $
player => P
Monster => M
Empty land => .

Project construction time: two weeks
